# ## Development

# This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated version management and package publishing.

# ### Automated Releases

# Releases are automatically created when changes are pushed to the `main` or `master` branch using [npm trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) with OpenID Connect (OIDC). This eliminates the need for long-lived npm tokens and automatically generates provenance attestations for supply chain security.

# The release process:

# 1. Analyzes commit messages to determine the next version number
# 2. Generates release notes from commits
# 3. Updates the package version
# 4. Publishes to npm with cryptographic provenance
# 5. Creates a GitHub release

# #### Commit Message Format

# To trigger a release, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in your commit messages:

# - `fix:` - patches a bug (PATCH version bump)
# - `feat:` - introduces a new feature (MINOR version bump)
# - `BREAKING CHANGE:` - introduces a breaking change (MAJOR version bump)
